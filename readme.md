# Job Listings Project

![](./public/desktop.png)

## Overview

This project displays job listings. Each job item shows the company name and logo, the job role, level, technologies and tools required for this role. It also shows how long ago the job was posted.
It allows the user to filter the job listings by clicking on tags. The user can also clear all the filters by clicking "clear" on the FilterBar (which is only visible when some filter is selected). The user can also remove a specific filter by either clicking on "remove" button in the FilterBar, or by clicking on the tag again.
